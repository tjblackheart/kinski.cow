# kinski.cow

Do you know that feeling when you have to forcefully kill a process because it hangs and all you want is to throw a heartly "f*ck you" in his face? Well, now you can!

1. Install [cowsay](https://github.com/tnalpgge/rank-amateur-cowsay), preferrably done with you package manager of choice.
2. Move `kinski.cow` to `/usr/share/cowsay/cows` - the path depends on your OS, of course.
3. Add `kinski` to a PATH location to run it, i.e. `~/.local/bin/kinski`. Optional: Edit the lines inside.
5. ...
6. Profit! The next time you have to `kill -9` an annoying process, throw kinski after it! `kill -9 $PID; kinski`

Well, it's the small things. Long live cowsay!
